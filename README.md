# A Simple Tkinter Maths Quiz

This project is a small Tkinter application that asks users to solve some linear equations and keeps a record of their results.

The steps the user should take are currently as follow (⚠️ under construction):

1. The quiz begins by asking the user for their name.
2. The user is given five questions, each generated at random.
3. The answers are checked immediately
4. The final score and the total time is shown at the end of the quiz.
5. There is an option to view a leaderboard of 5 best times.

When a quiz attempt is completed, the user’s name, the time the quiz started, the time it finished, and the final score are written to a CSV file. Each run of the quiz produces a single row of results.

⚠️ This project is intended as a teaching example rather than a polished product.
